# beginner-projects
Some simple beginner projects, many of which can still be edited and optimized to your liking. 

** I apologize for naming most of the Java files Main.java,at the time I wasn't familar with classes so I mostly ran everything through that. 

1. Word counter -  a basic word counting program with a GUI, using Javaswing.

2. Percolation - Model to test percolation using weighted quick union.
